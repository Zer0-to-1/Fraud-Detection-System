## 🧠 Overview

Fraudulent activities in financial systems can lead to significant losses. This project aims to build a robust fraud detection system using supervised learning algorithms. It analyzes transaction data and predicts whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time fraud prediction
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score
- Interactive dashboard (optional)
- REST API for integration
