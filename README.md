## 🧠 Overview

Fraudulent activities in financial systems can lead to significant losses. This project aims to build a robust fraud detection system using supervised learning algorithms. It analyzes transaction data and predicts whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time fraud prediction
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score
- Interactive dashboard (optional)
- REST API for integration

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component        | Technology             |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Programming      | Python 3.8+            |
| Libraries        | scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn |
| Model Serving    | Flask / FastAPI        |
| Dashboard (opt.) | Streamlit / Dash       |
| Deployment       | Docker, Heroku / AWS   |

## 📦 Installation

```bash
🚀 Usage
To run the model locally:

bash
python app.py
To test the API:

bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"amount": 1000, "location": "NY", ...}'
📊 Dataset
We use the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset which contains anonymized features of transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

🧪 Model Training
bash
python train_model.py
This script handles:

Data cleaning

Feature scaling

Model training and saving

📈 Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using:

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC Curve

Precision, Recall, F1-score

🌐 Deployment
You can deploy the system using Docker:

bash
docker build -t fraud-detector .
docker run -p 5000:5000 fraud-detector
Or push to Heroku/AWS for cloud deployment.
